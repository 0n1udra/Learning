The escalator itself moves at a speed of <b>Ve</b> meters per minute. 
You can walk down the escalator at a relative speed of <b>Vy</b> meters per minute.
The length of the escalator is <b>L</b> meters.
Trains arrive <b>T</b> minutes apart.
<br />
Let t be the time between your arrival to the station if you stand still on the escalator 
and the arrival of the last train before your arrival.
Assume that t is a random variable uniformly distributed between 0 and T.
<br />
Return the probability of catching an earlier train if you choose to walk down the escalator 
instead of standing still on it.
