<html><head><title>10255. WizardsAppointments</title></head><body><h1>10255. WizardsAppointments</h1><h2>Problem</h2><p><td class="statText">Several wizards have scheduled appointments to meet with non-wizards.  Each wizard will have exactly one meeting with a non-wizard.  Unfortunately, some of the wizards have just realized that they will not be able to arrive at their meetings on time.  They will show up either too early or too late.
<br />
In an attempt to minimize the total waiting time, the wizards have decided to reschedule all of the meetings by shifting each one by the same amount of time.  The total waiting time includes the time spent by wizards waiting for non-wizards to show up and the time spent by non-wizards waiting for wizards to show up.  The non-wizards will all arrive exactly on time to the rescheduled meetings.
<br />
You are given int[]s <b>scheduledTimes</b> and <b>arrivalTimes</b>.  The i-th element of <b>scheduledTimes</b> is the original scheduled starting time for the i-th wizard's meeting.  The i-th element of <b>arrivalTimes</b> is the time when the i-th wizard will show up to his meeting.  All times are given in hours.  If you shift all the meetings by T hours, the total waiting time can be calculated as the sum of abs(<b>scheduledTimes</b>[i] + T - <b>arrivalTimes</b>[i]) over all the meetings.  

Return the number of distinct integer shifts which allow to minimize the total waiting time.</td></p><h2>Definition</h2><h3>Filename</h3><p>WizardsAppointments.py</p><h3>Signature</h3><p>int scheduleAdjustment(int[] scheduledTimes, int[] arrivalTimes)</p><h2>Constraints</h2><ul><li><td class="statText"><b>scheduledTimes</b> will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>arrivalTimes</b> will contain the same number of elements as <b>scheduledTimes</b>.</td></li><li><td class="statText">Each element of <b>scheduledTimes</b> will be between 1 and 10<sup>9</sup>, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText">Each element of <b>arrivalTimes</b> will be between 1 and 10<sup>9</sup>, inclusive.</td></li></ul><h2>Examples</h2><ul><li>scheduleAdjustment([10], [9]) = 1<td class="statText"><table><tr><td colspan="2" class="statText">The wizard will arrive at his meeting 1 hour earlier than the scheduled time.
