To save yourself some time, you've decided to write a program to answer this question.  In this problem, a <i>word</i> is defined as a non-empty sequence
of lowercase letters ('a'-'z').  A <i>phrase</i> is a non-empty sequence of words, where each pair of consecutive words is separated with exactly one space character.  A phrase is <i>palindromic</i> if it reads the same forward and backward, ignoring space characters.
<br /><br />
You are given a String[] <b>words</b>.  Return the number of different palindromic phrases that can be composed with the given words.  Each word in <b>words</b> can be used at most once within each phrase.  Two phrases are considered different if they are different strings, even if they read the same when ignoring spaces (for example, "a ba" and "ab a" are different phrases).</td></p><h2>Definition</h2><h3>Filename</h3><p>PalindromePhrases.py</p><h3>Signature</h3><p>long getAmount(String[] words)</p><h2>Constraints</h2><ul><li><td class="statText"><b>words</b> will contain between 1 and 13 elements, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText">Each element of <b>words</b> will contain between 1 and 13 lowercase letters ('a'-'z'), inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText">All elements of <b>words</b> will be distinct.</td></li></ul><h2>Examples</h2><ul><li>getAmount(['a', 'ba']) = 2<td class="statText"><table><tr><td colspan="2" class="statText">You&#160;can&#160;construct&#160;two&#160;palindromic&#160;phrases&#160;"a"&#160;and&#160;"a&#160;ba".</td></tr></table></td></li><li>getAmount(['ab', 'bcd', 'efg']) = 0<td class="statText"><table><tr><td colspan="2" class="statText">No&#160;palindromic&#160;phrases&#160;can&#160;be&#160;built.</td></tr></table></td></li><li>getAmount(['a', 'bba', 'abb']) = 7<td class="statText"><table><tr><td colspan="2" class="statText">Here we have 7 palindromic phrases: "a", "a bba", "abb a", "abb bba", "bba abb", "abb a bba", "bba a abb".
