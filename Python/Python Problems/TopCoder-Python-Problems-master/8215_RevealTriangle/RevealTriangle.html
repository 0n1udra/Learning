	Suppose there is a triangle of digits like the following:
</p>
<pre>74932
1325
457
92
1</pre>
<p>
	Each digit, with the exception of those in the top row, is equal to the last digit of the sum of 
	its upper and upper-right neighboring digits.
</p>
<p>
	You will be given a String[] <b>questionMarkTriangle</b> containing a triangle where 
	only one digit in each row is known and all others are represented by '?'s 
	(see example 0 for clarification).
	Each element of <b>questionMarkTriangle</b> represents a row of the triangle, and the rows are given 
	from top to bottom. Each element contains exactly one digit ('0'-'9') and 
	the remaining characters are all '?'s. Restore the triangle and return it as a 
	String[] without '?'s.

<pre>
4ab 
c2 
1
</pre>

Having done that, we start solving for the variables from the bottom to the top. First, we know that the last digit of (c + 2) is 1. Therefore, c must be 9:

<pre>
4ab 
92 
1
</pre>
Now we know that the last digit of (4 + a) is 9, which means a is 5:
<pre>
45b 
92 
1
</pre>

And, finally, the last digit of (5 + b) is 2, so b is 7.</td></tr></table></td></li><li>calcTriangle(['1']) = ['1']</li><li>calcTriangle(['???2', '??2', '?2', '2']) = ['0002', '002', '02', '2']</li><li>calcTriangle(['??5?', '??9', '?4', '6']) = ['7054', '759', '24', '6']</li></ul>
