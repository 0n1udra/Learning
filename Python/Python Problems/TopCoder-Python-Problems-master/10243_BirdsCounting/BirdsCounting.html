BirdsCounting</h1><h2>Problem</h2><p><td class="statText">In ecology, there are several ways of estimating the size of a population in a given area.  We are interested in estimating the size of a population of birds.  To do this, we will use the following procedure.<br />
<br />
First, there will be a data collection phase that lasts exactly <b>daysNumber</b> days.  Initially, all the birds are unmarked.  During each day of data collection, we will catch exactly <b>caughtPerDay</b> birds.  At the end of each day, we will examine each of the birds we have caught.  If a bird is unmarked, we will mark it.  If a bird is already marked, we will leave it alone (and it will remain marked).  We will then release all of them back into the wild before the next day begins.<br />
<br />
After the data collection phase is complete, we can use the number of unmarked birds caught each day to estimate the size of the population.<br />
<br />
To help our fellow ecologists in analyzing the collected data, we must compute the probability that after <b>daysNumber</b> days of data collection, there will be exactly <b>birdsMarked</b> marked birds assuming that there are <b>birdsNumber</b> birds in this area. Assume that the probability of being caught is exactly the same for every bird on every day.</td></p><h2>Definition</h2><h3>Filename</h3><p>BirdsCounting.py</p><h3>Signature</h3><p>double computeProbability(int birdsNumber, int caughtPerDay, int daysNumber, int birdsMarked)</p><h2>Constraints</h2><ul><li><td class="statText"><b>birdsNumber</b> will be between 1 and 20, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>caughtPerDay</b> will be between 1 and <b>birdsNumber</b>, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>daysNumber</b> will be between 1 and 5, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>birdsMarked</b> will be between 0 and <b>birdsNumber</b>, inclusive.</td></li></ul><h2>Examples</h2><ul><li>computeProbability(3, 1, 2, 2) = 0<td class="statText"><table><tr><td colspan="2" class="statText">After the first day, there will be exactly one marked bird.
