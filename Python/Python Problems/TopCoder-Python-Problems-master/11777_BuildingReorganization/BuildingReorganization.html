<br /><br />
There are N buildings in the capital. They are located in a row and numbered 0, 1, ..., N-1 from left to right. The height of building i is <b>heights</b>[i] floors. Each floor of each building has the shape of a unit cube.
<br /><br />
The current state of the capital is miserable: there are just buildings and no infrastructure, so people are unhappy. Michael decided to deconstruct two buildings and to build a mall and an entertainment center in their locations. The buildings that Michael wants to deconstruct have numbers <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>.
<br /><br />
Deconstruction of buildings is a non-trivial process. It is organized as a sequence of operations. Each operation consists of exactly 4 steps:
<ol>
<li>Choose one of two deconstructed buildings (<b>A</b> or <b>B</b>). Let X be the chosen building.</li>
<li>Lower the topmost floor in X to the ground in front of building X. Lowering the floor by a unit of distance costs 1 coin. I.e., if the building now has H floors, the total cost of lowering the topmost floor is H-1 coins. Note that once we lower the topmost floor, the new height of the building becomes H-1.</li>
<li>Choose a building Y different from <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>. Move the floor from the ground in front of building X to the ground in front of building Y. This operation costs <b>cost</b> * |X - Y| coins.</li>
<li>Lift the floor onto the top of building Y. Lifting the floor by a unit of distance has the same cost as lowering it. I.e., it costs H coins to lift the currently processed floor on the top of a building that currently has H floors. Note that once we are done, the new height of building Y will be H+1.</li>
</ol>
The deconstruction process is finished once both buildings <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> have no floors anymore.
<br /><br />
Return the minimum possible total cost of the whole process, in coins.</td></p><h2>Definition</h2><h3>Filename</h3><p>BuildingReorganization.py</p><h3>Signature</h3><p>long theMin(int[] heights, int A, int B, int cost)</p><h2>Constraints</h2><ul><li><td class="statText"><b>heights</b> will contain exactly N elements, where N is between 3 and 50, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText">Each element of <b>heights</b> will be between 1 and 500,000,000, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>A</b> will be between 0 and N - 2, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>B</b> will be between <b>A</b> + 1 and N - 1, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>cost</b> will be between 1 and 10,000,000, inclusive.</td></li></ul><h2>Examples</h2><ul><li>theMin([5, 5, 5], 0, 2, 10) = 215<td class="statText"><table><tr><td colspan="2" class="statText">There is not much choice here.
