CirclesCountry</h1><h2>Problem</h2><p><td class="statText">Circles Country is a country that contains several circular-shaped districts.  Some districts may be situated inside other districts, but their borders do not intersect or touch.  Qatam is a resident of Circles Country.  When he travels between two locations, he always tries to cross the fewest number of district borders as possible because crossing borders is usually a laborious task.
<br /><br />
Imagine Circles Country as an infinite plane.  You are given int[]s <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b> and <b>R</b>, where (<b>X</b>[i], <b>Y</b>[i]) are the coordinates of the i-th district's center and <b>R</b>[i] is its radius.  Qatam is currently at point (<b>x1</b>,<b>y1</b>) and he needs to get to point (<b>x2</b>,<b>y2</b>).  Neither of these points lies on a district border.  Return the minimal number of district borders he must cross to get to his destination.
