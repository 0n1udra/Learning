FeudaliasBattle</h1><h2>Problem</h2><p><td class="statText">Feudalia's military is preparing a preemptive strike against Banania's military installations.  Feudalia has two missile silos.  Each silo has an unlimited number of missiles at its disposal, but can only fire a single missile at a time.  When a missile is fired, it requires <b>takeOffTime</b> seconds before it can take off from its silo.  Once it takes off, it requires distance/<b>missileSpeed</b> minutes to reach its target, where distance is the Euclidean distance between the silo and the target.  When the missile reaches its target, the target is instantly destroyed.  After a missile takes off, its silo requires <b>rechargeTime</b> minutes of preparation before it can launch another missile.<br /><br />

Two missile silos may not seem like a lot, but Banania is also a small country with only two military bases.  It takes a single missile to destroy a military base.  The general has ordered you to destroy both of Banania's military bases in as little time as possible.  You are given int[]s <b>siloX</b>, <b>siloY</b>, <b>baseX</b> and <b>baseY</b>.  Your silos are located at (<b>siloX</b>[0], <b>siloY</b>[0]) and (<b>siloX</b>[1], <b>siloY</b>[1]), and the enemy bases are located at (<b>baseX</b>[0], <b>baseY</b>[0]) and (<b>baseX</b>[1], <b>baseY</b>[1]).  Return the minimum time in minutes required to destroy both enemy bases.</td></p><h2>Definition</h2><h3>Filename</h3><p>FeudaliasBattle.py</p><h3>Signature</h3><p>double getMinimumTime(int[] baseX, int[] baseY, int[] siloX, int[] siloY, int takeOffTime, int rechargeTime, int missileSpeed)</p><h2>Constraints</h2><ul><li><td class="statText"><b>takeOffTime</b> will be between 1 and 60, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>rechargeTime</b> will be between 5 and 1000, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>missileSpeed</b> will be between 1 and 2000, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>baseX</b>, <b>baseY</b>, <b>siloX</b> and <b>siloY</b> will each contain exactly 2 elements.</td></li><li><td class="statText">Each element of <b>baseX</b>, <b>baseY</b>, <b>siloX</b> and <b>siloY</b> will be between 0 and 1000000, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText">The locations for each base and silo will be distinct.</td></li></ul><h2>Examples</h2><ul><li>getMinimumTime([100, 500], [100, 100], [100, 500], [300, 300], 6, 10, 1) = 200<td class="statText"><table><tr><td colspan="2" class="statText">At time 0, the silo located at (100, 300) should fire a missile at the base located at (100, 100), and the silo located at (500, 300) should fire a missile at the base located at (500, 100).
