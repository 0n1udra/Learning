But instead of making users enter data into a rigid on-line form, they allow users to write letters containing information about their orders.  You are to write a program that figures out what a user's order really is.</p>
<p>You will be given the customer's <b>message</b>, and an array of <b>items</b> that they can order.  By using the following rules, you can figure out what they want to order.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each element of the message is an individual sentence.</li>
<li>Each sentence is composed of <i>words</i>, which are continuous sequences of letters, and <i>numbers</i>, which are contiguous sequences of digits, with no extra leading zeros. Words or numbers are separated by single spaces and there are no leading or trailing spaces. For example, "1 apple or 2 pears" and "table and chair" are valid inputs, and "3tables" and "&#160;&#160;007&#160;&#160;&#160;agent&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;" is not.</li>
<li>Each sentence that includes a number followed (one or more words later) by one of the items, should be considered an order request.  Only consider the <i>closest</i> number that appears before an item to be an order request for that quantity of that item. Similarly, only consider the closest item that appears after a number to be an order request for that quantity of that item. See the Notes section and Examples 2 and 4 for additional clarification.</li>
<li>A sentence can contain more than one order request.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are to return a int[] containing the items ordered by the customer. Each element of the returned int[] should indicate how many of the corresponding entry in the <b>items</b> array the customer ordered in the message.</p>
<p>As an example, if you were given the items {"hats", "shoes"} and the message was {"I would like to order 2 pairs of shoes and 3 hats"}, you would return {3, 2}.</p></td></p><h2>Definition</h2><h3>Filename</h3><p>OrderParser.py</p><h3>Signature</h3><p>int[] orderAmount(String[] items, String[] message)</p><h2>Constraints</h2><ul><li><td class="statText"><b>items</b> will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText">Each element of <b>items</b> will contain between 1 and 50 character, inclusive, and will contain lowercase letters ('a' - 'z') <i>only</i>.</td></li><li><td class="statText">The elements of <b>items</b> will be unique.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>message</b> will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText">Each element of <b>message</b> will be a sentence as described in the problem statement.</td></li><li><td class="statText">Each element of <b>message</b> will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText">Each element of <b>message</b> will contain only letters ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z'), digits ('0'-'9') or spaces.</td></li><li><td class="statText">Each element of <b>message</b> will contain at least one letter.</td></li><li><td class="statText">Each "number" in an element of <b>message</b> will be an integer between 0 and 1000, inclusive, with no extra leading zeros.</td></li></ul><h2>Examples</h2><ul><li>orderAmount(['apples', 'bananas', 'oranges'], ['Please send me 3 apples and 2 oranges', 'Do not mix the apples and oranges', 'I need 12 more apples', 'And 7 bananas']) = [15, 7, 2]<td class="statText"><table><tr><td colspan="2" class="statText">In the first sentence, the <i>closest</i> preceding number to "oranges" is 2.
