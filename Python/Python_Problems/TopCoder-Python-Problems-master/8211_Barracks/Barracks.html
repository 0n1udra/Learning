<html><head><title>8211. Barracks</title></head><body><h1>8211. Barracks</h1><h2>Problem</h2><p><td class="statText">As a serious strategy-games player, you decided to solve one of the most common problems - attacking your
opponent's building (barracks), which constantly produces new soldiers.<br /><br />

Before the attack, you've got <b>myUnits</b> soldiers. In a single round, each soldier can either kill one of your opponent's soldiers or inflict 1 hit point of damage to the barracks.<br />

Your opponent doesn't have any soldiers initially.  However, his barracks has <b>barHp</b> hit points and produces <b>unitsPerRound</b> soldiers per round.<br /><br />

The course of one round:<br />
1. Each solider from your army either kills one of your opponent's soldiers or inflicts 1 hit point of damage to the barracks.  Each soldier can choose to do something different.  When the barracks loses all of its hit points, it is destroyed. <br />
2. Your opponent attacks. He will kill k of your soldiers, where k is the number of remaining soldiers he has.<br />
3. If the barracks are not yet destroyed, your opponent will produce <b>unitsPerRound</b> new soldiers.<br /><br />

Your task is to destroy the barracks and kill all your opponent's soldiers. If it is possible, return the minimum number of rounds you need to do this.
Otherwise return -1.

- All your soldiers attack the barracks, leaving it with 1 hit point.<br />
- Your opponent has no soldiers, so he cannot kill any of your soldiers.<br />
- Your opponent's army increases from 0 soldiers to 15 soldiers.<br />
<br />
Round 2:<br />
- One of your soldiers destroys the barracks. The other nine kill 9 of your opponent's soldiers.<br />
- Your opponent has 6 soldiers, so he kills 6 of your soldiers.<br />
- The barracks have been destroyed, so no new soldiers are produced.<br />
<br />
Round 3:<br />
- You have got 4 soldiers, so you decrease your opponent's army to 2 soldiers.<br />
- Your opponent kills 2 of your soldiers.<br />
- The barracks have been destroyed, so no new soldiers are produced.<br />
<br />
Round 4:<br />
- You kill 2 remaining soldiers. <br /></td></tr></table></td></li><li>attack(1, 2, 1) = -1</li><li>attack(1, 1, 1) = 1</li><li>attack(25, 200, 10) = 13</li></ul>
