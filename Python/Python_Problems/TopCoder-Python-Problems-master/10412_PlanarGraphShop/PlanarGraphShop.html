In the Kocurkovo village there is a shop that sells simple planar graphs. (See Notes for a definition.)
</p>
<p>
The cost of any graph with X vertices and Y edges is (X^3 + Y^2) gold coins.
</p>
<p>
Monika has <b>N</b> gold coins, and she wants to spend all of them on simple planar graphs.
</p>
<p>
Write a method that gets the value <b>N</b> and computes the minimum number of simple planar graphs Monika has to buy in order to spend exactly <b>N</b> gold coins.
She is allowed to buy multiple graphs of the same type.
