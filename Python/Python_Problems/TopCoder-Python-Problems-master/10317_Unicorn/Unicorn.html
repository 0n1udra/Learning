The unicorn is an exotic chess piece similar to the knight. The difference is that while the knight moves two cells in one direction and one in the other direction, the unicorn moves <i>more than</i> two cells in one direction and <i>more than</i> one in the other direction.
</p>
<p>
More precisely, each unicorn move looks as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>pick up the unicorn;</li>
<li>pick one of the four basic directions, and move the unicorn more than two cells in that direction;</li>
<li>pick one of the two basic directions that are orthogonal to the previous one, and move the unicorn more than one cell in that direction;</li>
<li>put down the unicorn.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We have a chessboard that has <b>R</b> rows times <b>C</b> columns. 
Each cell of the chessboard contains one of the first <b>L</b> letters of the alphabet.
To keep the input small, the content of the cells is randomly generated using the method
described below.
</p>
<p>
You are given the ints <b>R</b>, <b>C</b>, and <b>L</b> described above, an int <b>seed</b> used to generate
the letters in the cells, and a String <b>word</b>. You want to trace the String <b>word</b> by taking a unicorn, placing it onto a cell containing the
first letter of <b>word</b>, making a valid move that takes it onto a cell that contains the second letter, from there making another
move to the third letter, and so on.
Return the number of ways in which this can be done, modulo 1,000,000,007.
</p>
<p>
The content of the cells is generated using the following pseudocode:
</p>
<pre>
x = <b>seed</b>;
d = (65535 div <b>L</b>)+1;
for (int r=0; r<<b>R</b>; r++)
  for (int c=0; c<<b>C</b>; c++) {
    x = (x * 25173 + 13849) modulo 65536;
    chessboard[r][c] = character with ASCII code (65+(x div d));
  }

When generating the input we will compute d=32768, and then generate the content of the cells. The variable <tt>x</tt> will have the following values, in order: 17332, 39133, 37242, 14235, 656, 12265, 20598, 6471, 51372, 44853, 44210, and 45363. The generated chessboard looks as follows:
</p>
<pre>
ABBA
AAAA
BBBB

There are only two ways a unicorn can trace the word "AB" on this chessboard. It has to start in one of the two top corners, and then jump into the opposite corner.
