We are interested in estimating the size of a population of birds.  To do this, we will use the following procedure.<br />\n<br />\nFirst, there will be a data collection phase that lasts exactly <b>daysNumber</b> days.  Initially, all the birds are unmarked.  During each day of data collection, we will catch exactly <b>caughtPerDay</b> birds.  At the end of each day, we will examine each of the birds we have caught.  If a bird is unmarked, we will mark it.  If a bird is already marked, we will leave it alone (and it will remain marked).  We will then release all of them back into the wild before the next day begins.<br />\n<br />\nAfter the data collection phase is complete, we can use the number of unmarked birds caught each day to estimate the size of the population.<br />\n<br />\nTo help our fellow ecologists in analyzing the collected data, we must compute the probability that after <b>daysNumber</b> days of data collection, there will be exactly <b>birdsMarked</b> marked birds assuming that there are <b>birdsNumber</b> birds in this area.
