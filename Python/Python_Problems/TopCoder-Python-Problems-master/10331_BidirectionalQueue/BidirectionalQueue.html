<br />
You can do 3 kinds of operations with this queue:
<ol><li>
Extract first element. After applying this operation, queue a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>K</sub> becomes a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>K</sub>.
</li><li>
Shift queue elements left. After applying this operation, queue a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>K</sub> becomes a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>K</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>.
</li><li>
Shift queue elements right. After applying this operation, queue a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>K</sub> becomes a<sub>K</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>K-1</sub>.
</li></ol>
You are given the initial number of elements in the queue <b>N</b> and a int[] <b>indices</b> which contains the initial (1-based) positions of wanted elements in the queue. Return the minimal number of left and right shifts you'll have to perform to extract the wanted elements in the given order.</td></p><h2>Definition</h2><h3>Filename</h3><p>BidirectionalQueue.py</p><h3>Signature</h3><p>int extractElements(int N, int[] indices)</p><h2>Constraints</h2><ul><li><td class="statText"><b>N</b> will be between 1 and 50, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>indices</b> will contain between 1 and <b>N</b> elements, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText">Each element of <b>indices</b> will be between 1 and <b>N</b>, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText">All elements of <b>indices</b> will be distinct.</td></li></ul><h2>Examples</h2><ul><li>extractElements(10, [1, 2, 3]) = 0<td class="statText"><table><tr><td colspan="2" class="statText">The elements are extracted in the same order as they appear in the queue, so no shifts are required.</td></tr></table></td></li><li>extractElements(10, [2, 9, 5]) = 8<td class="statText"><table><tr><td colspan="2" class="statText">To extract the first wanted element, 1 left shift is required.
