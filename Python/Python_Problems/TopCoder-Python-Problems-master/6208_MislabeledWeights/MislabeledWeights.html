Unfortunately the weights you use as counterbalances are not accurate.  Some of them may be marked incorrectly - either 1 gram too heavy or one gram too light. (Some may be marked correctly.)</p>
<p>You are given a int[] <b>weights</b> representing the set of weights you have. The i-th of your weights is marked by <b>weights</b>[i] grams. The subset of your weights is called <i>good</i> if it's possible that all the real weights in it sum exactly to <b>testWeight</b>. Find the good subset with the minimum possible number of weights and return the number of weights in it. If there is no good subset of weights, your method should return -1.</p></td></p><h2>Definition</h2><h3>Filename</h3><p>MislabeledWeights.py</p><h3>Signature</h3><p>int fewest(int[] weights, int testWeight)</p><h2>Constraints</h2><ul><li><td class="statText"><b>weights</b> will contain between 1 and 10 elements, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText">Each element of <b>weights</b> will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>testWeight</b> will be between 1 and 10000, inclusive.</td></li></ul><h2>Examples</h2><ul><li>fewest([1, 1, 1], 6) = 3<td class="statText"><table><tr><td colspan="2" class="statText">The subset of all weights is the only good one.
