<html><head><title>10294. SkiFriction</title></head><body><h1>10294. SkiFriction</h1><h2>Problem</h2><p><td class="statText">Kate is standing on a pair of skis at the beginning of a straight path.  The path consists of n segments of equal length.  You are given a String <b>pathFriction</b> representing the friction of the path. The i-th character of <b>pathFriction</b> is a digit between '1' and '9', inclusive, representing the friction of the i-th segment of the path. (All indices in this problem are 0-based.)<br />
<br />
In this problem, we will treat Kate's skis as one single ski. The ski consists of m segments of equal length. A ski segment has the same length as a path segment. The friction of the ski is given in the String <b>skiFriction</b>, where the i-th character is a digit between '1' and '9', inclusive, representing the friction of the i-th segment of the ski.<br />
<br />
Initially, Kate is standing in such a way that the i-th segment of her ski touches the i-th segment of the path.  She will move forward one segment at a time until the (m-1)-th segment of her ski touches the (n-1)-th segment of the path.  Each time she moves forward one segment, she moves at the speed of the slowest segment of her ski.  The time required for a segment of her ski to move forward by one segment is equal to the friction of that ski segment plus the friction of the path segment it currently touches.<br />
<br />
Return the total time required for Kate to ski to the end of the path.<br /></td></p><h2>Definition</h2><h3>Filename</h3><p>SkiFriction.py</p><h3>Signature</h3><p>int bestPosition(String skiFriction, String pathFriction)</p><h2>Constraints</h2><ul><li><td class="statText"><b>skiFriction</b> will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>skiFriction</b> will contain only digits between '1' and '9', inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>pathFriction</b> will contain between m and 50 characters, inclusive, where m is the number of characters in <b>skiFriction</b>.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>pathFriction</b> will contain only digits between '1' and '9', inclusive.</td></li></ul><h2>Examples</h2><ul><li>bestPosition('45', '15196') = 33<td class="statText"><table><tr><td colspan="2" class="statText">At the beginning of Kate's first move, the segment of her ski with friction 4 touches the segment of the path with friction 1 (for a total friction of 5).
