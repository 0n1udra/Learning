An interval [A,B], where B is greater than A, and A and B are positive integers, is considered unlucky if none of the integers between A and B, inclusive, belongs to <b>luckySet</b>.<br /><br />

An integer x is considered to be luckier than another integer y if the number of unlucky intervals that contain x is smaller than the number of unlucky intervals that contain y.  In case both x and y belong to an equal number of unlucky intervals, or both belong to an infinite number of unlucky intervals, the smallest of them is considered to be luckier than the other.<br /><br />

Given a int[] <b>luckySet</b>, return the top <b>n</b> luckiest positive integers sorted in descending order by luckiness (in other words, each element of the int[] must be luckier than the next element).</td></p><h2>Definition</h2><h3>Filename</h3><p>UnluckyIntervals.py</p><h3>Signature</h3><p>int[] getLuckiest(int[] luckySet, int n)</p><h2>Constraints</h2><ul><li><td class="statText"><b>luckySet</b> will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText">Each element of <b>luckySet</b> will be between 1 and 1000000000, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText">Each element of <b>luckySet</b> will be distinct.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>n</b> will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.</td></li></ul><h2>Examples</h2><ul><li>getLuckiest([3], 6) = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]<td class="statText"><table><tr><td colspan="2" class="statText">0 unlucky intervals contain 3.<br />
1 unlucky interval contains 1: [1,2].<br />
1 unlucky interval contains 2: [1, 2].<br />
Since 1 and 2 are inside an equal number of intervals, 1 is considered luckier because it is less than 2.<br />
For every number greater than 3, there is an infinite number of unlucky intervals that contain it.
