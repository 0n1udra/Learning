CellRemoval</h1><h2>Problem</h2><p><td class="statText">In biology, organisms have the following property: Starting from the first cell (the zygote), each cell during an organism's development process either divides into 2 other cells or does not divide at all.  An organism is mature when all of its cells will not divide any further.<br />
<br />
Let's assign a unique number to each cell in an organism's development process.  For example, consider a species in which each organism starts with cell 0, which divides into cells 1 and 2.  Cell 1 divides into cells 3 and 4.  Cells 2, 3 and 4 do not divide.  Every mature organism of this species will consist of exactly 3 cells - 2, 3 and 4.<br />

<br />
During the development process, if we kill a cell, it will be absent in the mature form of the organism.  If that cell happens to be a cell that divides, then the mature organism will be missing all of the cell's descendants as well because the cell is killed before it has a chance to divide.  For example, in the organism described above, if we kill cell 1 during the development process, the mature organism will contain only cell 2.<br />

You are given a int[] <b>parentCell</b> describing the development process of an organism.  The i-th element of <b>parentCell</b> is the parent cell of cell i (where i is a 0-based index).  The zygote's parent is -1.  Return the number of cells the mature form of this organism would have if you killed cell <b>deletedCell</b> during the development process.</td></p><h2>Definition</h2><h3>Filename</h3><p>CellRemoval.py</p><h3>Signature</h3><p>int cellsLeft(int[] parent, int deletedCell)</p><h2>Constraints</h2><ul><li><td class="statText"><b>parentCell</b> will contain exactly N elements, where N is an odd integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText">There will be exactly one "-1" element in <b>parentCell</b>.</td></li><li><td class="statText">Every element of <b>parentCell</b> will be between -1 and N-1, inclusive.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>parentCell</b> will form a binary tree.</td></li><li><td class="statText"><b>deletedCell</b> will be between 0 and N-1, inclusive.</td></li></ul><h2>Examples</h2><ul><li>cellsLeft([-1, 0, 0, 1, 1], 2) = 2<td class="statText"><table><tr><td colspan="2" class="statText">This is the example organism from the problem statement.
