	There are some books, each consisting of exactly three parts: introduction, story and edification. 
	There is a reader who goes through the books and reads various parts. 
	Each time he finishes reading a part, he adds the name of the part to the end of a list. 
	He may read zero or more parts from each book, and he can read them in any order, but he cannot 
	read each part more than once. 
	Whenever he starts reading a new book, he can no longer go back and read any parts of books he has 
	looked at previously.
</p>
<p>
	You are given a String[] <b>readParts</b> containing the list created by the reader. 
	Each element of <b>readParts</b> is "introduction", "story" or "edification" (quotes for clarity). 
	Return the maximum possible number of books for which the reader has read all three parts.
