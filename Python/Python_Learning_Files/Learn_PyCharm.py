----- Useful Stuff -----
Enable all of PEP8 to Warnings in inspection
hold option/alt and click other places to have multiple cursors, to type multiple lines at once!
double press option/alt then use arrows to add more cursors
hold ctrl then use arrows to go through open tabs
hold command/..  while pressing enter to create new line in the code but without cursor moving
use inspect code to find errors, redundant things, spelling, and PEP guidelines. works on directories too.
use the favorites panel.速速速速
